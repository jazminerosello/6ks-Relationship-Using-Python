6k's Relationship is a python terminal based program game that is similar to flames. Unlike to the ordinary flames, in this python program, the processto determine the result of the relationship of the two names user entered are the following:

- Common letter from the two names will be removed.
- Sum up the remaining letters from two names.
- Count the 6K's (Kaibigan, Kapuso, Kaaway, Kasal, Kilig(crush), Kapatid) and if for example the sum of the remaining letters from both names is 6 then count 1-6 from kaibigan up to kapatid, if it stops, cross out the K then repeat counting until one K remain from the 6K which will be the result of the game.
